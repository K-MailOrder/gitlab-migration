# Gitlab Migration
Script to migrate Gitlab groups and their projects from one Gitlab instance to another. 

## Requirements
* Bash (4.0 or newer)
* jq (1.6)
* curl (7.68.0 tested)

## Usage ## 
* Create local file `.secrets` and add a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html) for the source Gitlab instance in the first line and a Personal Access Token for the target Gitlab instance in the second line. Also add a newline (LF) to the end. Both tokens need the `api` scope. Example:
    ```
  $ cat .secrets
  dskjfdskjfr7987dfkds
  jdskfsdjflk238dg762a
  ```
* Create the target group in the target Gitlab instance. **CAUTION: You should always make sure that you set the appropriate visibility level and other important security settings on the target group before you start the migration so that no sensitive data is exposed by accident!** See details on additional protective default settings at [Supported Features](#supported-features).
* Run the migration script:
  ```bash
  $ SOURCE_GITLAB=git.mycompany.com TARGET_GITLAB=gitlab.com ./migrate.sh
  Enter source group path at git.mycompany.com (e.g. project/team): 
  Enter target group path at gitlab.com (e.g. mycompany/project/team): 
  Archive original projects at git.mycompany.com after migration? (yes/no): 
  ...
  ```

## Limitations ##
* Tested with Gitlab 13.0 / 14.0
* Currently only Community Edition features are supported. See [list of supported features](#supported-features) below for details. This doesn't limit the script to Community Edition Gitlab instances though. It can be used with any of Community, Enterprise or Gitlab.com SaaS instances as source and target.
* The target group path already has to exist
* Max. 100 Subgroups, Variables, Hooks, Badges per parent entity will be migrated as no API pagination is implemented
* If you hit an error during the migration, you might have to wait several minutes before resuming, as Gitlab has some pretty tight rate limiting restrictions for project exports: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/import_export.html#rate-limits

## Supported Features ##
* Groups including nested groups. See [Group API documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/groups.html#list-groups) for supported attributes.
The following attributes will be overwritten with some restrictive values to not expose sensitive data by default. This is especially handy if you're moving from a private on-premise instance to Gitlab.com. 
You can always change the settings back after the migration manually or edit the script to not override these attributes if you want to keep the original settings.
  * `visibilty=private`
  * `request_access_enabled=false`
  * `require_two_factor_authentication=true`
  * `share_with_group_lock=true`
* Project Export Package. See [Gitlab Import/Export documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/import_export.html#exported-contents) for details
* Optional:
  * Group CI variables
  * Group badges
  * Project CI variables
  * Project webhooks
  * Add link to new location in source project description
  * Archive source projects after migration
